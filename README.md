# Disentangling Interest and Conformity for an Adversarial Learning-Based Personalized Recommendation System

Welcome to the code repository for the DICA project.

ðŸš€ About the Project

The DICA model addresses the challenges of popularity bias in recommendation systems, which often overemphasize popular items

This project aims to:

Rank learning with DICE

We utilize the DICE mechanism to learn rankings, which employs disentangled embeddings of conformity and interest.

Adversarial learning

Additionally, adversarial learning is employed to promote fair recommendations between popular and unpopular items.
