# Disentangling Interest and Conformity for an Adversarial Learning-Based Personalized Recommendation System
### Welcome to the code repository for the DICA project.

ðŸš€ About the Project

The DICA model addresses the challenges of popularity bias in recommendation systems, which often overemphasize popular items

This project aims to:

Mitigate popularity bias through disentangled embeddings of interest and conformity.
Enhance fairness without compromising generalizability by employing adversarial learning.
Offer robust recommendations without relying on auxiliary information like gender or occupation.
DICA builds on the DICE mechanism with innovations in causal modeling and adversarial learning techniques.
