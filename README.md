🚀 About the Project

The DICA model addresses the challenges of popularity bias in recommendation systems, which often overemphasize popular items

## This project aims to:

## **Rank learning with DICE**

  We utilize the DICE mechanism to learn rankings, which employs disentangled embeddings of conformity and interest.
  
## **Adversarial learning**

  Additionally, adversarial learning is employed to promote fair recommendations between popular and unpopular items.
